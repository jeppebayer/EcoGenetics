# What type of sequencing has been used on the samples, individual sequencing or pooled sequencing (individual | pooled)
sequencing_type: individual
# Ploidy of sample. If sample is pooled the value should equal the total number chromosome copies
ploidy: 2
# Freebayes is a haplotype-based variant caller. The value of 'bestn' is the max number of best alternative haplotypes to consider when more are available.
# This is very time and memory intensive (don't use a value higher than 3).
bestn: 3

Project description.

I have chosen to call this its own project due to its large scope and workload.

This project concerns the assembly and annotation of reference genomes for the museomics project and the population genetics projects.
The project covers the creation of reference quality genomes covering the following steps:
    - Initial assembly of PacBio HiFi data.
    - Chromosome level assembly using Hi-C data.
    - Gene annotation using RNA data.

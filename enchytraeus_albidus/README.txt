Project description.

Collaboration with Palle Villesen et al.
Palles group are working with Enchytraeus albidus for which they are making a reference genome.
They have made several variations of an initial draft: '8k_q20', '8k_q20_l0', '8k_q30', '8k_q30_l0'.
These vary in the parameters:
    - Quality threshold, q20 or q30
    - hifiasm purge-dups, auto or none (l0)
We were asked to improve on the assembly by purge-dupping, evaluating with BUSCO scores and map 24 samples to the purge-dupped genome assembly.
BUSCO analysis has been done using the matazoa database (this may be to wide a database)

8k_q20 purge-dupped twice has been chosen as the best option for a reference genome.

# Terminals and file explorers and more

## The all-in-one

My personal preference and recommendation is to use [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This acts as an effective all-in-one, you'll have terminal, file explorer and script editor all in one place. To further incite you to make this (the right) choice, I've even made a little guide to setting up VScode ready for you: [VScode Guide](/vscode_guide.md)
